🍔 Command-Line Food Ordering App
A Python-based command-line application that simulates a food ordering system. Forked and enhanced from vikram-singh9/Order_Management_App_Python, this project has been upgraded with better user experience, extended functionalities, and cleaner code structure.

🚀 Features
📋 Menu Display – Browse through a categorized food menu (e.g., Main Course, Drinks, Desserts).

🛒 Order Management – Add, remove, and view items in your cart before placing an order.

💸 Billing System – Get an itemized bill with totals and taxes at checkout.

🔁 Repeat Ordering – Loop back to main menu after completing an order to continue or exit.

🧼 Code Improvements – Modular structure, better input handling, and user prompts.

🛠 Modifications by Lincoln Madaraka
✅ Improved input validation (handles edge cases and invalid entries more gracefully).

✅ Added category-based filtering for menu items.

✅ Enhanced order summary formatting for better readability.

✅ Modularized code into multiple functions for clarity and maintainability.

✅ Customizable tax and discount features added for experimentation.

✅ Added session timestamps and order IDs for better tracking (optional).
